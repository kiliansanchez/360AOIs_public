\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class serves as a base for all clickable children of the timeline. it makes sure that the hover state between the timeline and its children is properly handed-\/over. For example if the user clicks on a keyframe and then drags the cursor, that should not move the playhead on the timeline because the user wanted to interact with the keyframe, not the timeline. Vice versa if the user scrubs the playhead across the timeline hovering over a keyframe should not trigger a click on the keyframe. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
