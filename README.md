## Abstract
This master’s thesis presents the development and validation of a software tool for preparing
and conducting eyetracking experiments in VR with 360° videos. The program allows for
the annotation of dynamic Areas of Interest (AOIs) on any 360° video. Subsequently, par-
ticipants can view the video in VR using an HTC Vive Pro Eye VR headset, and relevant
eyetracking parameters related to the predefined AOIs are analyzed and provided. The soft-
ware validation was carried out through experiments in which the gaze movements of six
participants were recorded, manually coded, and then compared with the data export from
the software. Additionally, the software’s fixation detection was compared with an existing
software package. The results demonstrate a high level of agreement between the software,
manual ratings, and the comparison software package, indicating the software’s potential as
an effective data collection tool.
