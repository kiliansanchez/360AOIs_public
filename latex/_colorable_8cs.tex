\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Class that was supposed to allow AOIs to be recolored from AOI List or \doxylink{class_right_click_menu}{Right\+Click\+Menu}. Not implemented though, so class is mostly useless. Currently only handles color of AOI based on whether or not AOI is selected by user. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
