\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This script is attached to AOIs and is responsible for the creation of handles as well as resizing. Resizing happens when the user drags a handle of the currently selected AOI across the screen. Something of note\+: Resizing is done by changing the vertices of the AOIs mesh. Moving the vertices doesn\textquotesingle{}t automatically recalculate the center (origin) of the game object, so this class manually recenters the objects origin during and after resizing is completed. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
