\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_animation}{Animation}} \\*This script does a lot of things and should probably be refactored into multiple classes. a) Creates \& Updates Keyframes for position, size and shape of AOI Does this by listening to Draggable\+Around\+Cameras and Resizables events b) Calculates position, size and shape for Frames between Keyframes using interpolation c) Animates object based on current frame of video by setting position, size and shape according to calculated frames }{\pageref{class_animation}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_o_i_component}{AOIComponent}} \\*This is the base class for components that make up an area of interest. The user can highlight and work with one AOI at a time, marking that one as active (done by the AOI Manager) This class subsribes to the event of changing the active AOI and specifies the relevant methods (On\+Activate, On\+Deactivate) that need to be implemented by derived classes }{\pageref{class_a_o_i_component}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_o_i_manager}{AOIManager}} \\*This class does 3 things 1.\+Manages AOIs based on user input a) Deactivates currently active AOIs and spawns new AOIs if user clicks on empty space in 360 degree video b) Sets an AOI as active when user clicks on AOI in 360 degree video and deactivates the previously selected AOI }{\pageref{class_a_o_i_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_event_detection_1_1_aoi_parameters}{Event\+Detection.\+Aoi\+Parameters}} }{\pageref{class_event_detection_1_1_aoi_parameters}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_save_and_load_a_o_is_1_1_a_o_i_save_data}{Save\+And\+Load\+AOIs.\+AOISave\+Data}} }{\pageref{class_save_and_load_a_o_is_1_1_a_o_i_save_data}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_camera_drag}{Camera\+Drag}} \\*This script is attached to the Editor Camera and allows the User to change the portion of the 360 degree video being displayed, by holding down right click and dragging. The camere then rotates based on the cursor movement }{\pageref{class_camera_drag}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_change_color_on_dwell}{Change\+Color\+On\+Dwell}} \\*This script inherits from the \doxylink{class_raycast_hit_handler}{Raycast\+Hit\+Handler} and therefore its functiones are called by the \doxylink{class_gaze_raycaster}{Gaze\+Raycaster}. It simply changed the color of the object it is attached to when the gaze of the person wearing the vr headset is over the object }{\pageref{class_change_color_on_dwell}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_clickable_on_timeline}{Clickable\+On\+Timeline}} \\*This class serves as a base for all clickable children of the timeline. it makes sure that the hover state between the timeline and its children is properly handed-\/over. For example if the user clicks on a keyframe and then drags the cursor, that should not move the playhead on the timeline because the user wanted to interact with the keyframe, not the timeline. Vice versa if the user scrubs the playhead across the timeline hovering over a keyframe should not trigger a click on the keyframe }{\pageref{class_clickable_on_timeline}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_colorable}{Colorable}} \\*Class that was supposed to allow AOIs to be recolored from AOI List or \doxylink{class_right_click_menu}{Right\+Click\+Menu}. Not implemented though, so class is mostly useless. Currently only handles color of AOI based on whether or not AOI is selected by user }{\pageref{class_colorable}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_save_and_load_a_o_is_1_1_datalist}{Save\+And\+Load\+AOIs.\+Datalist}} }{\pageref{class_save_and_load_a_o_is_1_1_datalist}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_display_as_frame_on_timeline}{Display\+As\+Frame\+On\+Timeline}} \\*This classed is used for any UI element that should be displayed as a certain frame on the timeline for example a keyframe for frame 47 always needs to be positioned where frame 47 is on the timeline, regardless of scale / zoom level of the timeline. This class handles that }{\pageref{class_display_as_frame_on_timeline}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_draggable_along_x_y_plane}{Draggable\+Along\+XYPlane}} \\*This script is attached to every AOI handle and allows the handle to be dragged along the XY plane of its parent(the AOI) }{\pageref{class_draggable_along_x_y_plane}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_draggable_around_camera}{Draggable\+Around\+Camera}} \\*This script is attached to AOIs and allows them to be dragged around to position them within the 360 degree video }{\pageref{class_draggable_around_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_draggable_on_timeline}{Draggable\+On\+Timeline}} \\*This class allows an object which is displayed on the timeline (using Display\+As\+Frame\+On\+Timeline\+COmponent) to be dragged along the timeline using the mouse. (Used by the playhead to scrub along the timeline) }{\pageref{class_draggable_on_timeline}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_editor_camera}{Editor\+Camera}} \\*This script is attached to the editor camera and does two things a) gives a static reference to the \doxylink{class_editor_camera}{Editor\+Camera} to be used for e.\+g. position calculation etc. b) matches the editor camera rotation to the VR cameras rotation if flag is set by user }{\pageref{class_editor_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_event_detection_1_1_event}{Event\+Detection.\+Event}} }{\pageref{class_event_detection_1_1_event}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_event_detection}{Event\+Detection}} \\*This script contains all the event-\/detection algorithms for detecting dwells and fixations with their respective parameters like duration etc }{\pageref{class_event_detection}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_event_detection_tester}{Event\+Detection\+Tester}} \\*Some testing code for the event detection. Generates a list Eye\+Tracking\+Data\+Samples, then creates an event detection object and passes the list as parameter. The created csv file can be checked manually and compared to the created Eye\+Tracking\+Data\+Samples }{\pageref{class_event_detection_tester}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_eye_recorder}{Eye\+Recorder}} \\*Derived from SRanipal example script. This script is responsible for getting the eyedata from the VR-\/\+Headset, storing the data during recording as well as carrying out the raycast to check whether or not the gaze is hitting a AOI. Note\+: Callback runs on a separate thread to report at \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}120hz. Unity is not threadsafe and cannot call any Unity\+Engine api from within callback thread }{\pageref{class_eye_recorder}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_eye_tracking_data_sample}{Eye\+Tracking\+Data\+Sample}} \\*Dataclass for storing all relevant data for a single eyetracking sample }{\pageref{class_eye_tracking_data_sample}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_f_p_s_counter}{FPSCounter}} \\*Script to display FPS counter on the top right of screen. Source\+: \href{https://forum.unity.com/threads/fps-counter.505495/}{\texttt{ https\+://forum.\+unity.\+com/threads/fps-\/counter.\+505495/}} }{\pageref{class_f_p_s_counter}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_animation_1_1_frame_data}{Animation.\+Frame\+Data}} }{\pageref{class_animation_1_1_frame_data}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_gaze_raycaster}{Gaze\+Raycaster}} \\*Creates a raycast from current eyedata gaze direction. If an object with the \doxylink{class_raycast_hit_handler}{Raycast\+Hit\+Handler} component is hit by racast this script calls the On\+Raycast\+Enter and On\+Raycast\+Extit methods on entry and exit of the object. This allows objects to react to beeing looked at by the participant }{\pageref{class_gaze_raycaster}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_gaze_ray_renderer}{Gaze\+Ray\+Renderer}} \\*Derived from SRanipal Example Scripts. This script displays the current gaze of the participant as a colored ray within the experimentor-\/view of the application }{\pageref{class_gaze_ray_renderer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_gaze_simulator}{Gaze\+Simulator}} \\*Another test-\/script. The code generates fixations at a specified Vector3. Instead of creating a eventdetection object here the fake\+\_\+data is used in the eyerecorder class when the Use\+Simulated\+Data\+Instead flag is set to true }{\pageref{class_gaze_simulator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_gaze_to_texture_mapper}{Gaze\+To\+Texture\+Mapper}} \\*Proof of concept class. Derived from shader code of Unity Panoramic\+Shader. Allows to map the gaze direction onto pixel coordinates of the skybox-\/texture. Can be used in the future to create different types of visualizations }{\pageref{class_gaze_to_texture_mapper}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_handle_for_resizable}{Handle\+For\+Resizable}} \\*This script is attached to every AOI-\/\+Handle. It signals the parent object that a handle has been clicked and resizing should start. Requires the parent to have the \"{}\+Resizable\"{} Component }{\pageref{class_handle_for_resizable}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_helper}{Helper}} }{\pageref{class_helper}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_listable}{Listable}} \\*This script manages the name of the AOI and its representation in the AOIList in the UI }{\pageref{class_listable}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_log_messages_manager}{Log\+Messages\+Manager}} \\*Script managing the creation of logs in the error/debug log console. Console can be opened and closed by pressing \textquotesingle{}F1\textquotesingle{} }{\pageref{class_log_messages_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_menu_close_logic}{Menu\+Close\+Logic}} \\*Tiny little script thats attached to everything that should be \"{}closed\"{} when the user clicks outside of it\+::s bounds. Mostly used for menus that should dissapear when user clicks outside of them }{\pageref{class_menu_close_logic}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_playhead}{Playhead}} \\*Implements the playhead. Inherits \doxylink{class_draggable_on_timeline}{Draggable\+On\+Timeline} }{\pageref{class_playhead}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_pre_video_test_scene}{Pre\+Video\+Test\+Scene}} \\*Handles display of testscene after vr is enabled but before recording starts }{\pageref{class_pre_video_test_scene}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_raycast_hit_handler}{Raycast\+Hit\+Handler}} \\*Abstract class that defines On\+Raycast\+Enter and On\+Raycast\+Exit for interaction with \doxylink{class_gaze_raycaster}{Gaze\+Raycaster}. Should probably be an interface in the future }{\pageref{class_raycast_hit_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_record_button}{Record\+Button}} \\*Script attached to record button at the top right corner of UI. Handles sprite changes based on events }{\pageref{class_record_button}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_resizable}{Resizable}} \\*This script is attached to AOIs and is responsible for the creation of handles as well as resizing. Resizing happens when the user drags a handle of the currently selected AOI across the screen. Something of note\+: Resizing is done by changing the vertices of the AOIs mesh. Moving the vertices doesn\textquotesingle{}t automatically recalculate the center (origin) of the game object, so this class manually recenters the objects origin during and after resizing is completed }{\pageref{class_resizable}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_right_click_menu}{Right\+Click\+Menu}} \\*This script can be attached to any gameobject to display a menu when the gameobject is right-\/clicked. Currently used on AOIs and keyframe-\/icons }{\pageref{class_right_click_menu}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_setup}{Setup}} \\*Currently doesen\textquotesingle{}t do too much. Sets target framerate of application to 120Hz }{\pageref{class_setup}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_event_detection_tester_1_1_tester_sample}{Event\+Detection\+Tester.\+Tester\+Sample}} }{\pageref{class_event_detection_tester_1_1_tester_sample}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_timeline}{Timeline}} \\*Implements functionality of timeline. Allows timeline to be scrubbed and to zoom in on the timeline to be able to move playhead with more precision to better place keyframes }{\pageref{class_timeline}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_video_manager}{Video\+Manager}} \\*This class handles the videoplayer component and its events }{\pageref{class_video_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_visual_angle_tester}{Visual\+Angle\+Tester}} }{\pageref{class_visual_angle_tester}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_v_r_button}{VRButton}} \\*Attatched to VR Button. Manages interactability as well as sprite changes for button }{\pageref{class_v_r_button}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_v_r_camera}{VRCamera}} \\*Attached to the camera used by the VR headset and sets the cameras culling mask and clear flags }{\pageref{class_v_r_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_v_r_manager}{VRManager}} \\*Handles activation and deactivation of Unitys XR Framework and SRanipal Eye Framework }{\pageref{class_v_r_manager}}{}
